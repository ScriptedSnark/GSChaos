# GSChaos

ASI plugin for GoldSrc Engine (steam_legacy / HL25). Adds "Chaos" in game.

Inspired by Chaos mods from the GTA universe (by zolika1351), I decided to make my own for HL1 and GoldSrc in particular (you can run almost any mod with it).

Additional info:
- Chaos UI rendering is not visible in OBS scene if third-party overlays checkbox is unchecked (doesn't matter if you capture hl.exe as a window, not game)
- Save your game more often because of potential softlocks/crashes
