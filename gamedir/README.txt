ADDITIONAL INFO
==============

- !!!Some effects like "Creepypasta Mode", "rorriM" and so on are not visible in OBS scene if third-party overlays checkbox is unchecked (doesn't matter if you capture hl.exe as a window, not game)!!!
- Save your game more often because of potential softlocks/crashes

CVARS AND COMMANDS
==============
- `chaos_activate` - activate effect (from 0 to (LATEST EFFECT NUM - 1)) | `sv_cheats 1` is required!
- `chaos_reset` - reset RNG, chaos bar (can be useful for potential runs)
- `chaos_version` - prints version and Chaos Mod details
- `chaos_dmca_safe` - if enabled, it doesn't allow to play some sounds which are Â©
- `chaos_effectname_ypos` - sets position of effect name text by vertical (Y coord)
- `chaos_show_voting` - draw voting progress in Chaos UI so you can see it without checking OBS
- `chaos_timer` - sets time until the next effect
- `chaos_draw_as_overlay` - if enabled, it draws Chaos UI as overlay and requires enabling 3rd-party overlays in OBS

TWITCH CHAT VOTING INTEGRATION
==============
GSChaos supports Twitch chat voting. If you want to use it, then do some steps:
1. Edit `chaos/twitch.ini`. It should have your [OAuth password](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) and Twitch username
2. Add text element (GDI) to your OBS scene
3. Pass a path of `chaos/voting_progress.txt` in text options
4. Run the game and check if everything is installed successfully (wait for 10 seconds in game after chaos bar activating so you can check voting system)

To vote, you need to type "NUMBER" in chat (for example, "2").
If you don't want to play with this feature, rename `twitch.ini` to `twitch_DISABLED.ini`.

TROUBLESHOOTING
==============
Issue: "Could not find filesystem dll to load."
Solution: "Do not replace hl.exe. It seems like you use build 3248 which is encrypted. Use installation guide for 2005 WON. You can find backup of original hl.exe in certain folder."

Issue: "Failed to initialize GLEW. Exiting..."
Solution: "Check if your GPU has updated drivers and supports GLSL shaders."

Issue: Effect "High" doesn't work.
Solution: "If you use HL25, disable shader stuff ("gl_use_shaders 0" or just disable it in video options). Otherwise, it seems like custom mod replaces shader and we can't do anything to fix that."

Some effects can't work with custom mods which replace original game logic / monsters.
